## About The Project

Our project focuses on analyzing bird sighting data from multiple sources to draw meaningful insights into bird species' migration patterns, population densities, and habitat preferences. By combining traditional data analysis methods with modern data science techniques, we aim to contribute valuable information to the birdwatching community and wildlife conservation efforts.

## Datasets

We utilize three primary datasets in our analysis:

### Dataset Part 1: CornellLab FeederWatch Bird Sightings

- **Description**: This dataset includes detailed records of bird sightings from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's FeederWatch program, featuring species details, sighting locations, and latitude-longitude coordinates.
- **Source**: [CornellLab FeederWatch Bird Sightings](https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/)

### Dataset Part 2: Bird Names with Images

- **Description**: Comprising bird names accompanied by high-quality images, this dataset serves as a visual reference to enhance our understanding of the species observed in the FeederWatch data.
- **Source**: [Bird Names with Images](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds)

### Dataset Part 3: State/County/ZIP Boundaries

- **Description**: Geo polygons representing state, county, and ZIP boundaries are utilized to map bird sightings accurately to specific locations, aiding in spatial analysis.
- **Source**: [State/County/ZIP Boundaries](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
